Install the following to download install scripts from github:
git
github-cli

Download Scripts from Github, Use the following command

git clone https://github.com/PCTLC157/Archlinux-Scripts.git

To make files executable, navigate to folder location of scripts (Right Click, select, Open In Terminal) and run the following:
sudo chmod +x archlinux-post-install.sh aur.sh desktops.sh

To run any of the three scripts use any of the following commands
./archlinux-post-install.sh
./aur.sh
./desktops.sh

The command may change depending on which type of shell you are using.

NOTE: The aur.sh script is not needed if you enable (My Personal Repo) arch-repo-pctlc which has all the AUR packages available through the pacman -S command when added to etc/pacman.conf file.
NOTE: There is an option to install Trizen within the menu of the archlinux-post-install.sh script, however Trizen is installed when installing General Packages from the General Menu.
